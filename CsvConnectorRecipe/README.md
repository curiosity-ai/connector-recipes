# CSV Connector Recipe — Exploding Flattened Entities

Demonstrates the most common CSV-ingestion pattern: a single row that bundles **many entities** (a Student, their University, Department, Degree, Major, Advisor, City, plus pipe-delimited Subjects and Skills) gets exploded into typed nodes and connected with bidirectional edges.

## The CSV

[`data/students.csv`](./data/students.csv) — 10 rows, 15 columns. Each row is one student with everything about them flattened in:

```
student_id,student_name,birth_year,enrollment_year,gpa,university,department,degree,major,advisor_name,advisor_email,subjects,skills,country,city
S001,Alice Chen,2003,2022,3.85,MIT,Computer Science,BSc,Artificial Intelligence,Marcus Hill,mhill@mit.edu,Calculus|Linear Algebra|ML Foundations|Probability,Python|TensorFlow|PyTorch|Git,USA,Cambridge
```

`subjects` and `skills` are **pipe-delimited** lists (`|`) — many-per-row fields collapse to one cell.

## The graph

Each row produces:

| Source columns | Node type | Key |
|---|---|---|
| `student_id`, `student_name`, `birth_year`, `enrollment_year`, `gpa` | `Student` | `student_id` |
| `university` | `University` | `name` |
| `department` (+ `university`) | `Department` | `"<University>/<Department>"` |
| `degree` | `Degree` | `name` |
| `major` | `Major` | `name` |
| `subjects` (split on `|`) | `Subject` × N | `name` |
| `skills` (split on `|`) | `Skill` × N | `name` |
| `advisor_name`, `advisor_email` | `Advisor` | `email` |
| `country` | `Country` | `name` |
| `city` (+ `country`) | `City` | `"<City>, <Country>"` |

Edges (forward / reverse pairs, all bidirectional):

```
Student ──EnrolledAt──> University
Student ──BelongsToDepartment──> Department ──PartOf──> University
Student ──PursuesDegree──> Degree
Student ──HasMajor──> Major ──OfferedBy──> Department
Student ──Studies──> Subject
Student ──HasSkill──> Skill
Student ──AdvisedBy──> Advisor ──WorksIn──> Department
Student ──LivesIn──> City ──In──> Country
```

Why composite keys for `Department` and `City`? "Computer Science" exists at every university; "Cambridge" exists in USA and UK. Plain names would collapse them into one node and corrupt traversal — `"<University>/<Department>"` and `"<City>, <Country>"` keep them distinct without losing the human-readable `Name` property.

## Running

Set the environment variables and run:

```bash
export CURIOSITY_URL=http://localhost:8080/
export CURIOSITY_API_TOKEN=<token from "Manage → API integrations" in your workspace>
export CURIOSITY_CONNECTOR_NAME="CSV Recipe (Students)"

cd CsvConnectorRecipe
dotnet run
```

To iterate on the parser without touching the graph:

```bash
RECIPE_SMOKE=1 dotnet run
```

To override the CSV location:

```bash
RECIPE_CSV_PATH=/path/to/your.csv dotnet run
```

## Sample queries

Open the workspace UI, then `Manage → Shell`, and try:

```csharp
// Sanity check — relationship counts across the entire graph.
return Q().EmitNeighborsSummary();
```

```csharp
// Every student.
return Q().StartAt(N.Student.Type).Take(50).Emit("N");
```

```csharp
// All subjects studied by Alice Chen.
return Q().StartAt(N.Student.Type, "S001")
          .Out(N.Subject.Type)
          .Emit("N");
```

```csharp
// Every student at MIT, with their major.
return Q().StartAt(N.University.Type, "MIT")
          .In(N.Student.Type)
          .Out(N.Major.Type)
          .Emit("N");
```

```csharp
// Students who share the "Python" skill — useful for "find similar people".
return Q().StartAt(N.Skill.Type, "Python")
          .In(N.Student.Type)
          .Emit("N");
```

```csharp
// Faceted view: how many students each advisor has.
return Q().StartAt(N.Advisor.Type)
          .EmitNeighborsSummary();
```
